Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================================

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# Steps to work on this course project
1.Download run_analysis.R.
2.Modify line 5 specifying the folder in which you want the downloaded data to be stored
3.Modify line 15 specifying the working directory you want to set
3.Run the script. It will produce a result file inside the folder you specified in point 2.

# Packages to be used
run_analysis.R will automatically install the package needed (data.table; dplyr).
